# JapaneseReadingPracticeNET
a visual version of my other Japanese Practice project.

This project is done mainly for my personal study of Japanese language. 
Personally, one of my main stumbling blocks is reading the japanese alphabets at a fast pace.
So, this little app is my solution for it.

How it works:

It generates a random, nonensical phrase in Hiragana (And Katana in the future) and you have to re-write it in romanji
as fast as possible.
Your type time is stored, along with your success rate.
